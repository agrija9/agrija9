### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a machine learning engineer at Epirus in Torrance, California. I am in charge of modeling radio-frequency power amplifiers using neural networks with applications to RF design, RF simulations, digital pre-distortion and other microwave systems.

I was a machine learning researcher at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/web/) (Robotics Innovation Center (RIC)) in Bremen, where I applied self-supervised learning techniques to underwater sonar and camera images focusing on underwater robot navigation and perception. Prior to that, I worked as a machine learning researcher at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)](https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in Bonn, where I applied generative modeling to time series for unsupervised anomaly detection and 3D reconstruction of turbulent flows. I obtained my M.Sc. in [Autonomous Systems](https://www.h-brs.de/en/inf/study/master/autonomous-systems) from the University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg (Germany) and my B.Sc. in Physics from the [Universidad Autonoma de Baja California (Mexico)](http://www.uabc.mx/), I wrote my B.Sc. thesis at the [National Metrology Institute of Germany (PTB)](https://www.ptb.de/cms/en.html) in the field of [Trapped-Ion Quantum Engineering](https://www.quantummetrology.de/equopt/home/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and statistical modeling with broad applications to computer vision, time series, and telecommunications.
